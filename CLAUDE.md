/init

You are an expert full-stack engineer and product designer.  
Your mission is to create a **job search assistant platform** with a **dashboard web app** and a **companion Chrome extension**.  

### 🎯 Goal
Help users collect job offers from *any website*, store them in a database, filter/search/rate them, and compare them to their resume.  
The platform should feel like a professional dashboard, with **clean UI**, **AI-powered scraping**, and **resume-to-offer matching**.

---

### 🔑 Core Features

1. **Authentication system**
   - Email/password auth (secure, standard best practices).
   - Only authenticated users can use the Chrome extension or dashboard.

2. **Job Offer Extraction (Chrome Extension)**
   - On any job offer webpage, the user clicks a button in the extension.
   - The extension extracts all possible job info:
     - Title, company, location, salary (if available), contract type, required skills, description, perks, remote/hybrid/onsite status, etc.
   - Extraction should be AI-augmented:
     - Use AI scraping/parsing (can leverage installed tools like `n8n` and `ollama`, or call an API).
     - Must work on arbitrary sites, not just well-known platforms.
   - Data is sent to the backend and stored in the database.

3. **Dashboard (Web App)**
   - Users can see all extracted job offers.
   - Features:
     - Filtering (by company, salary range, remote status, skills, etc.).
     - Sorting (by extraction date, rating, match score).
     - Rating system (⭐ 1-5 stars per job).
     - Upload resume (PDF) to user profile.
     - AI-powered matching system:
       - Compare resume content with each job offer.
       - Display a match percentage.

4. **Database**
   - Should work **locally** during dev, but scalable later.
   - Must support structured job schemas (not pure unstructured NoSQL blobs).
   - You decide the best approach (SQL with Prisma or MongoDb and mongoose).
   - Schema must cover:
     - Users, job offers, ratings, resumes, and AI match scores.

5. **Frontend**
   - Built with **Next.js + shadcn/ui**.
   - Must feel like a real dashboard (sidebar, filters, job cards, profile page).
   - Clean, minimal, professional look.

6. **Tests**
   - Pertinent unit and integration tests only.
   - No E2E tests.
   - Cover business logic, parsing, and AI matching.

---

### 📐 Guidelines

- **Tech stack**: Use technologies that AI coding agents handle extremely well:
  - Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui for frontend.
  - Node.js/Express (or Next.js API routes) for backend.
  - Prisma + SQLite (for local dev) or Firestore alternative for persistence.
  - Jest for testing.
- **Code organization**: Keep clear module boundaries (auth, jobs, resumes, ratings, AI services).
- **Chrome Extension**:
  - Simple popup UI with a button “Extract Job Offer”.
  - Content script scrapes DOM → sends to backend for AI enrichment → saved in DB.
- **AI Enrichment**:
  - Use Ollama or OpenAI API for parsing + standardizing job offer data.
  - Should fall back gracefully if some fields can’t be parsed.
- **Resume Matching**:
  - Parse resume PDF → extract skills/experience → vector similarity (basic embedding approach).
  - Compute a % match score for each job.

---

### 🧑‍💻 User Journey

1. User signs up or logs in.
2. Installs Chrome extension.
3. On a job offer page → clicks “Extract Job Offer”.
4. Extension scrapes the page → AI normalizes fields → data stored in DB.
5. User opens dashboard:
   - Sees a list of extracted jobs.
   - Can filter, sort, or star-rate jobs.
   - Uploads resume → match scores appear next to jobs.
6. User continues to collect, rate, and review offers.

### 🚀 Deliverables

- Full project scaffold with working auth, DB, API routes, frontend pages, and Chrome extension boilerplate.
- Sample test suite (unit + integration).
- Example resume matching logic with embeddings.
- Seed/demo data for testing.
- Clear README with setup instructions.

---

Now, start generating the project scaffold with these requirements.  
Follow guidelines strictly, but make reasonable technical choices when unspecified.  
Prioritize maintainability, developer experience, and polished UX.
